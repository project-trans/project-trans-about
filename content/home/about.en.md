Project Trans (formerly known as MtF.wiki) aims to better maintain multiple projects including MtF wiki, FtM wiki and more.

Project Trans strives to create a free, open and continuously updated platform to provide transgender related knowledge and information. We believe that everyone has an equal right to choose their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, free from stigma, discrimination, and violence.

We welcome more people to [join us](https://github.com/project-trans) and contribute to the transgender community.
